          After speaking to some users and doing my online research, and
          analyzing the gathered information from the online research and user
          interviews, to help have a linear direction, I categorized the
          insights into these 2 categories.

              'Personality and tone are key to conversational interfaces. There should be a human touch to the bot personality for better experience.',

              'Stop gaps - control shouldn’t be taken fully away from users. They should be able to confirm everytime an action needs ti be taken and clarify their intents.',
              'Less typing, more clicking - the interface experience shouldn’t be fully text-based as this might lead to lower completion rates if users have to do mostly typing. Giving users option to select/click their answers will improve the UX.',
